             <h3>Computer Science</h3>
             <p>I started getting interesting in Computer Science (CS) once I started participating in my middle school's robotics team. I learned about both the building aspect and coding aspect of robotics, and became more attracted to coding. I then started learning more computer langauges, and have experience in Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming. I want to continue exploring my interesting in CS by learning about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, and more. Explore the CS page to read computer science blog posts that I have written!  </p>

            <h3>Dance</h3>
             <p> I started dancing at about the age of 4. During this time, I learned Bollywood dance and a classical form of Indian dance known as Bharatanayam. Once I was 13, I wanted to start branching out and began to learn American dance styles. Now, I am currently learning Ballet, Lyrical/Contemporary, Jazz, Hiphop, and more. I take dance classes at my high school, including a Choreography class. I also have participated in various school dance teams: The Lawrenceville Dance Team (Lyrical/Contemporoary), Tour de Force (Hiphop and Jazz), and Sauve (Spanish dancing). On Tour de Force, I assist in choreographing and leading the team sometimes. Explore the dance page to see videos of dances I have performed or choreographed! </p>

            <p>Translation: <br> I have been learning Chinese for 6 years. I started learning Chinese in middle school. Since I thought that learning Chinese was fun and interesting, I also took Chinese classes after I start high school. My teacher have taught me how to speak Chinese, and also how to write Chinese characters. Read my essays in Chinese!</p>
